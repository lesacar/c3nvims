# My Neovim Syntax Plugin

Attempt at syntax highlighting for c3 in neovim, because no other plugin works, my first attempt at creating a vim plugin so it will probably not work too.
Plguin actually useless for now, if yo're setting up c3.vim and c3_lsp, do it outside of Mason and treesitter because they don't have c3 support yet.

## Installation

```lua
{
    'lesacar/c3nvims',
    ft = 'c3',
}
